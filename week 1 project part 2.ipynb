This data includes 11 rows, of which only state (i.e. Berlin or Hamburg), ZIP-code (10 for Berlin, 22 for Hamburg), latitude and longitude per ZIP-code will be needed. ZIP-codes will be used for dividing both cities into smaller areas. ZIP-code is chosen as it is an unique identifier. In the following this data is cleaned and filtered to what is needed.\n",
